# Product Management System Using HashMap

This Java program is a simple product management system that allows users to perform various operations such as adding products to a cart, checking the cart, searching for products, removing products, buying products, and viewing available products.

## Features

- Product in Shop: Displays the list of available products.
- Add Product into Cart: Allows users to add products to their cart.
- Check Cart: Displays the products currently in the cart.
- Check How Many Products in Cart: Shows the total number of products in the cart.
- Search Product: Enables users to search for a specific product.
- Remove Product: Allows users to remove a product from the cart.
- Buy Product: Simulates the buying process and provides options for payment.
- Exit: Terminates the program.

## How to Run

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files using any Java compiler (e.g., `javac Product_menu.java`).
3. Run the compiled `Product_menu` class (e.g., `java Product_menu`).

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program.

## Notes

- The program provides basic functionality for managing products and carts. It can be extended further to include additional features such as user authentication, persistence (e.g., storing data in a database), and more robust error handling.
- For simplicity, the program assumes a single-user environment and does not implement user authentication.
- Error handling is limited in this version of the program. Invalid user inputs or exceptional cases may not be handled gracefully.
